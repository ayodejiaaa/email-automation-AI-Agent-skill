# Non-Disruption Contract

"Non-disruptive" is a promise that must be **enforced**, not assumed. Complete every item before you
call the build done.

---

## 1. Back up first

- Snapshot the database (or at least the affected tables) before running any migration.
- Note the pre-change email mailer config so it can be restored.

## 2. Additive, reversible schema only

- **Never alter or drop existing tables/columns.** Add new tables only (`email_*`, `user_events`).
- Every migration must have a working `down()` that drops only what the feature added.
- No data back-fills that touch existing rows.

## 3. Observe-only hooks that never throw

- Wrap **every** event hook in `try/catch`; log and swallow. A failing observer must never break
  registration, login, cart, checkout, or payment.
- No changes to the app's request path, middleware order, or existing email config.

## 4. Ships paused + global kill switch

- `email_settings.master_enabled = false` on install.
- A one-click **global kill switch** stops all sends instantly without unenrolling users.
- Per-sequence toggles default to off.

## 5. Reuse the existing mail connection

- No second SMTP/provider. No changes to existing transactional email.

## 6. Smoke test after install (prove nothing broke)

Run and record: register a test user → log in → add to cart → start checkout → complete a test order.
All existing flows must behave exactly as before. Only the new admin menu/UI is new.

## 7. Verify the automation in dry-run

- Dry-run mode sends to **the admin's own address only** and writes no `email_sent` rows.
- Preview every sequence; stop-conditions must fire in tests (`examples/worker.test.mjs`).

## 8. Rollback drill (documented + tested)

1. Turn the master switch **off** (stops sends immediately).
2. Run the migrations' `down()` to drop the additive tables.
3. Remove the admin routes/menu.
4. Confirm the app's original email config and flows are untouched.

## 9. Access control

- The admin page, admin tables, test-send, and exported data require the app's **admin permission**.
- Audit admin actions (who toggled, who edited a sequence, who test-sent).
